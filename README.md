# google-cloud-ctr-prediction
This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning deployment pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the Avazu Click-Through-Rate dataset. It integrates BigQuery, Vertex AI Workbench, Cloud Storage, and Vertex AI Endpoints to train, register, and deploy an XGBoost model for real-time prediction.
